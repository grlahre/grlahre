### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Griffin Lahre. I am a student at Syracuse in the Applied Data Science program. I live in Washington, DC, and work in the financial sector. I enjoy landscape photography and making BBQ. My favorite sports teams are the Kansas City Chiefs, since I grew up there, and the Ohio State Buckeyes, which is my undergrad alma mater. 

I taught myself how to code VBA when I got out of school, and always enjoyed automation and data analysis, but my skills were "crude." I hope to sharpen skills and techniques, and learn new ones altogether during this program.
